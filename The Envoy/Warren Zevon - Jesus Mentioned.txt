Artist : Warren ZevonTitle : Jesus MentionedI'm going down to Memphis
Memphis, Tennessee
I'm going down to Graceland
Thinking about the King
Remembering him sing
About those heavenly mansions
Jesus mentioned
Can't you just imagine
Digging up the King
Begging him to sing
About those heavenly mansions
Jesus mentioned
He went walking on the water
He went walking on the water
He went walking on the water
With his pills
Can't you just imagine
Digging up the King
Begging him to sing
About those heavenly mansions
