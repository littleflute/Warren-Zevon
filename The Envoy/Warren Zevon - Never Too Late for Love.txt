Title: Never Too Late for Love

You can't find him, the way is dim
You feel like giving up
You ache for her
Rest assured, it's never too late for love

You say, you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word
Every time it hurts, you say, you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word, everybody hurts

Things go wrong, the days are long
You think you've had enough
You feel discouraged
Rest assured, it's never too late for love

You say, you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word
Every time it hurts, you say, you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word, everybody hurts

Who am I to say, I know the way you feel
I've felt your pain and I know your sorrow
You could try to let the past slip away
Live for today, don't stop believing in tomorrow

You've come so far, the way is dark
You feel like turning back
But the way is black
The way is black

You can't find him, the way is dim
You feel like giving up
You ache for her
Rest assured, it's never too late for love

You say, you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word
Every time it hurts, you say you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word, everybody hurts

Who am I to say, I know the way you feel
I've felt your pain and I know your sorrow
You could try to let the past slip away
Live for today, don't stop believing in tomorrow
