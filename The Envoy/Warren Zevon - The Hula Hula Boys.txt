Artist : Warren ZevonTitle : The Hula Hula BoysI saw her leave the luau with the one who parked the cars
And the fat one from the swimming pool, they were swaying arm in arm
I could hear the ukuleles playing down by the sea
She's gone with the hula hula boys, she don't care about me
She's gone with the hula hula boys and she don't care about me
They're singing
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Yesterday she went to see the Polynesian band
But she came home with her hair all wet
And her clothes all filled with sand
I didn't have to come to Maui to be treated like a jerk
How do you think I feel when I see the bellboys smirk?
And I can hear the ukuleles playing down by the sea
She's gone with the hula hula boys, she don't care about me
They're signing
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puanaWritten by:
