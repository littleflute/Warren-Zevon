Artist : Warren ZevonTitle : Charlie's MedicineCharlie dealt in pharmaceuticals
Charlie used to sell me pills
Yesterday his sister called to tell me he'd been killed
Some respectable doctor from Beverly Hills
Shot him through the heart
Charlie never felt a thing
Neither of them did, poor kid
Charlie dealt in pharmaceuticals
He sold those expensive drugs
I gave Charlie all my money
What the hell was I thinking of?
Charlie had to take his medicine
Charlie got his prescription filled
I came to say goodbye, I'm sorry Charlie died
I came to finish paying my bill
I came to finish paying my bill
I came to finish paying my bill
I came to finish paying my bill
Charlie dealt in pharmaceuticals
Charlie used to sell me pills
Yesterday his sister called to tell me he'd been killed
Charlie had to take his medicine
Charlie got his prescription filled
I came to say goodbye, I'm sorry Charlie died
I came to finish paying my bill
I came to finish paying my bill
I came to finish paying my bill
I came to finish paying my billWritten by:
