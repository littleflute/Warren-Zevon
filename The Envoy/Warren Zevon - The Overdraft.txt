Artist : Warren ZevonTitle : The OverdraftI had a little girl, now
We crossed the state line
It was more than just an overdraft
We were looking at time
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer, no
We had to leave in a hurry now
No time to hesitate
It was worse than misunderstanding
I had to ask her not to call it fate
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer
Yeah!
No one sleeps on the yellow line
No one's that alone
Someone's in the window
So don't try to use the phone
We're just up against it
We turned up in the zone
But if you ever get an overdraft
You'll never make it home
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer, ha
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answerWritten by:
